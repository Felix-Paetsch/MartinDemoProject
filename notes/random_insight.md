A plugin could have meta data which another plugin can request,
including default expected timeout or other quirks.

Debug system:
Each plugin randomly sends out a system of asserts it assumes on the other plugins (only works for full integrity)

File system:
Provider, ability to subscribe / unsubscribe..

WASM:

- how does it work
- do some testing
- feedback loop how long it expects to take

SubPlugins (e.g. several shaders in one plugin)
