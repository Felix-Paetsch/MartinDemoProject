- Overwrite ResultPromise
- export ProtocolError
- better errors

- Move things to effect.fn
- Still debug logging

- Sport
- Move to new System
- Locally Computed Message Data
- Inactive Environment
- Get Known addresses
- Clean Up
- Current Effects are not stateless when not executed
- Make plugin lib and co into Effect.fn; specifically registering plugins
  Good back and forth integration of effect errors and own errors; in particular maybe done want to translate both back and forth.
- resultFunc

Allow for advanced communication channels:

- Under the hood several channels
- Retry logic
- Notify kernel
- Allowing to keep middleware
- Error handlung callbacks & cokg

- look at current things
- less effect in martin initialization
- allow async callbacks everywhere
- testing (an array/set of test scenarios that should just work)

- maybe explicit result promise extends promise
- local env should not be that different from non-local
- unify how we put mw
- debug annotation
- Why is current sender not current source ==> Bcs its a local environment (I think)
  ==> Local Plugin Environment?

- Listener Suite
- Wider communication Channels
