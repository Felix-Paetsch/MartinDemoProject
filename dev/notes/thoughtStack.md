# Todo
- maybe move find responder to the corresponding things that can respond
- see what can be simplified
- answer martin
- make a list of things we might want long term (respond anyway on error for example, but this probably comes wiht the "error" update)


- see if demo runs
- move find responder
- simplify
- write down that in theory we could have async problems, e.g. with message channel messages ariving before the channel is initialized
