GOALS
================
2. Write Docs (or types) for desired behaviour of Asset API
3. Write Docs for and implement Plugin Lifecycle - including batched events
4. UI management

A. Protocols 
    - Transmissions of Errors
    - Less back and forth ("trust") ~ only expose those Errors I cant fix
B. Write Docs for different API layers
    => Specification for BugFixes
    => Check independence of Rest (and exposition of all necessary API features)
    => Eventually don*t have to look at it at all ( BUG PTSD )
    - Communication between two non-local things is messed up rn
C. Fix Asset API
    - Implement propert Spec
    - Add modularity for persistence
    - Speed updates for multiple changes at once
    - System Files ~ modular
D. Debug Tools
    - Trackability
    - Fuzzy
